## Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s world all the bad news is highlighted, there is more news coverage than ever and every day it seems it is another day the entire world is on fire. I want to visualize that this is not always the case, we are moving in the right direction. And i want to show this by visualizing the military expenditure and compare this with the educational expenditure and simultaneously visualize the world wide number of armed conflict casualties.
