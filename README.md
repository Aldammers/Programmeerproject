## Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s world all the bad news is highlighted, there is more news coverage than ever and every day it seems it is another day the entire world is on fire. This lack of knowledge on the data about the real state of this world is what I partly want to resolve.  
## Solution
And to show this I will focus on every countries military and education spending and even additional government spending (%GDP on security, health care, mental health), and visualize what is important for a happy country. More education or more military? And while this question is being answered we get a good image on the year to year trend on military, educational and happinness index.

The woldmap will be interactive as the user can select which year it wants to visualize and on which country it wants to focus. And the line and bar graph next to it will depend on the country which will be selected and will show a year to year trend on military and educational spending and the happiness index.
